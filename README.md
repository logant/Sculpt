*Example showing two scenarios for conference room model. Left shows a uniform, brightly light scene. Right shows a comparatively dim ambient scene with a uniformly lit table.*

Sculpt is a partnership with Renesselaer Polytechnic Institue's Light Enabled Systems and Applications (LESA) and Center for Architecture, Science and Ecology (CASE) groups, Lumileds, and HKS, Inc. The research project aims to evaluate the use of beam-steerable LED lighting fixtures to provide lighting across multiple scenarios with a single type of dynamic LED light fixture that can be adapted for mass market adoption via a 2x2 troffer design.
